Create a distributed job scheduling system using Python. The system should allow multiple worker nodes to pick up tasks from a shared queue, handle task dependencies, provide fault tolerance with automatic retries, and include a monitoring dashboard. Your implementation should use Redis for the queue, include proper logging, handle edge cases like worker failures, and use type hints throughout. Also explain the architectural decisions you made and how you'd scale this system to handle thousands of workers.
