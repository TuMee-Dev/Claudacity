# Ollama API Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Ollama API compatibility in the Claude proxy server.

## Implemented Features

### Core Ollama API Endpoints

- `/api/version`: Returns API version information
- `/api/tags`: Lists available models in Ollama format
- `/api/chat`: Handles chat conversations with both streaming and non-streaming modes
- `/api/generate`: Processes single-prompt completion requests

### Response Formatting

All responses are formatted to match Ollama's expected JSON structure:

- Non-streaming responses include metrics fields like `total_duration`, `eval_count`, etc.
- Streaming responses send chunks in Ollama's format with a final "done" message
- Model information is presented in Ollama's format with appropriate family/parameter details

### Test Coverage

Comprehensive test suite added:
- Tests for all Ollama API endpoints
- Test for streaming response format
- Tests for error handling
- Tests for model list formatting

## Integration with Existing Claude Functionality

The implementation reuses existing Claude integration:
- Uses existing conversation tracking
- Leverages existing Claude communication methods 
- Adopts consistent error handling patterns
- Maintains compatibility with Claude tools support

## Usage

Applications designed for Ollama can connect to this service by changing their base URL:

```
# Instead of connecting to Ollama's default:
http://localhost:11434

# Connect to Claude proxy server:
http://localhost:8000
```

## Documentation

Full documentation added in `OLLAMA_COMPATIBILITY.md` covering:
- API endpoints with request/response formats
- Implementation details
- Usage examples
- Limitations

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Support for more Ollama models or model mapping
- Enhanced parameter compatibility
- More detailed timing/metrics information
- Implementation of additional Ollama endpoints (if needed)
