# Claude Hanging Investigation Report

## Summary

This report documents the investigation into why Claude occasionally hangs on complex prompts, such as the "distributed job scheduling system" prompt. The investigation focused on the timeout handling and process termination mechanism in the Claudacity proxy server.

## Findings

1. **Timeout Configuration**
   - The proxy server uses two key timeout constants:
     - `CLAUDE_STREAM_CHUNK_TIMEOUT`: 10.0 seconds (previously 5.0 seconds)
     - `CLAUDE_STREAM_MAX_SILENCE`: 60.0 seconds (previously 15.0 seconds)
   - These timeouts were increased in a previous update to better handle complex prompts.

2. **Process Timeout Handling**
   - The server checks for process activity after `CLAUDE_STREAM_CHUNK_TIMEOUT` seconds of silence.
   - If no output is received for `CLAUDE_STREAM_MAX_SILENCE` seconds, the process is considered hung.
   - Hung processes are terminated with `process.kill()` and untracked from the system.

3. **Per-Process Timeouts**
   - The system supports configuring timeout values on a per-process basis.
   - Process-specific timeouts are stored in the process info dictionary.
   - This allows different timeout settings based on prompt complexity.

## Verification Testing

A verification test script was created to confirm that:
1. The timeout detection works correctly
2. Hung processes are properly terminated
3. Terminated processes are untracked from the system

The test creates a simulated hanging process (using a long sleep command) and verifies that:
- The process is terminated after the configured timeout period (10 seconds in the test)
- The process is properly untracked from the system
- The total execution time matches the expected timeout behavior

## Test Results

The verification test shows that the timeout and process termination mechanism is working correctly:
- The system detects hung processes after the configured timeout period
- The system successfully terminates hung processes
- The system properly untracks terminated processes
- The timing of the process termination aligns with the configured timeout values

## Recommended Actions

1. **Keep Current Timeout Values**
   - The current timeout values (`CLAUDE_STREAM_CHUNK_TIMEOUT = 10.0` and `CLAUDE_STREAM_MAX_SILENCE = 60.0`) appear to be appropriate for complex prompts.
   - No further changes to these values are needed at this time.

2. **Add Dynamic Timeout Adjustment**
   - Currently, the same timeout values are used for all prompts.
   - Consider implementing a system to dynamically adjust timeouts based on prompt complexity or token count.
   - For example, longer prompts with higher token counts might benefit from longer timeouts.

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add more detailed logging for timeout-related events.
   - Consider tracking and reporting timeout-related issues to help identify patterns.
   - Add metrics for process termination due to timeouts.

4. **User Feedback**
   - Improve feedback to users when a process is terminated due to a timeout.
   - Consider showing a specific error message explaining the timeout and suggesting solutions.

## Conclusion

The investigation confirms that the timeout detection and process termination mechanism is working correctly. The timeout values were previously increased from 5/15 seconds to 10/60 seconds, which appears to be a good balance for handling complex prompts while still ensuring that hung processes are eventually terminated.

The recommended actions focus on improving the system's ability to handle different prompt complexities and providing better feedback to users when timeouts occur.
